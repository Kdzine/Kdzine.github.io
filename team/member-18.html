					<h2 class="modal-title">Lynnette Cole</h2>
					<p class="large-text">
						A beauty expert and TV personality for more than 16 years, she has worked to empower women to be their best selves. Lynnette&rsquo;s interest in beauty began with a personal struggle with combination and problem skin. At a very early age, she became a maverick at camouflaging imperfections and putting her best face forward. She excelled at pageantry and was crowned Miss USA in 2000. Since then, she&rsquo;s also appeared in films like &ldquo;Funny Valentine&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shattered&rdquo;, on the popular daytime drama &ldquo;As the World Turns,&rdquo; and has hosted shows for NBC, CMT, ESPN, MTV and VH-1.
